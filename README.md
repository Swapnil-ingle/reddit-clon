### About the project
I started this as a learning experiment in the Angular. This is me first time doing Angular.

The goal of the project is not JUST to finish the project following the tutorial series but rather learning the concepts while achieving something tangible in the process (*P.S: I hate non-project based learning*). To corroborate this, I'm also writing some blog(s) to solidify the underlying technology that I've used in the project (ex: [Adding Sign-up with Angular](https://swapnil-ingle.github.io/add-signup-with-angular), [GitHub blogs](https://swapnil-ingle.github.io/))

### Progress so far...
#### Backend
* The backend is completely implemented with all the REST-API endpoints and working fine.
* The backend was done in Java using Spring Boot.
* Libraries like Lombok and mapstruct were used to reduce boiler plate code.
* The user authentication is done using JWT token with 15 min expire/refresh token approach.
* The backend API documentation is done using Swagger.

#### Frontend
* This is still in progress...
* Implemented the sign-up, sign-in functionality.
